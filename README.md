Online Pagoda
By Ray Nguyen
Proposal:

This project will simulate a visit to a pagoda. A person can pray, burn incense, touch the statue, or draw a fortune stick.
Anyone who comes to the pagoda can do all these activities.
Visiting the pagoda is a tradition on New Year Holiday in my country. However, with recent situation of COVID-19, it is not a good idea to gather a lot of people in a small place. With the help of Online Pagoda, this problem will be solved. This will also be a great solution for people who are too busy to actually visit a pagoda; while they will still have a chance to experience all kind of fascinating actvities.
User Stories:
As an user, I want to donate money to the statue
As an user, I want to view a list of statues
As an user, I want to view the money that have been donated for that statue
As a user, I want to add a statue to the pagoda (add multiple Xs to a Y; X is Statue, Y is Pagoda)
As a user, when I select the quit option from the application menu, I want to be reminded to save my list of statue to file and have the option to do so or not.
As a user, when I start the application, I want to be given the option to load my saved list from file.
Phase 4: Task 2
An example of logging events when the application runs:

Fri Apr 01 00:26:47 PDT 2022 $123 has been donated

Fri Apr 01 00:26:47 PDT 2022 A new statue is added to the list

Fri Apr 01 00:26:47 PDT 2022 $123 has been donated

Fri Apr 01 00:26:47 PDT 2022 A new statue is added to the list

Fri Apr 01 00:26:47 PDT 2022 A list of statues has been printed out

Phase 4: Task 3
If i had more time on the project, I would:

Change the order of the buttons into 2 columns
Change the appearance of the buttons
Make the menu picture a GIF
Finish a panel of viewing the donation
Add a graphic to the "Return" button
